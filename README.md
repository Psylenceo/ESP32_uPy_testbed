# ESP32_uPy_testbed
ESP32_uPy_testbed is ment as a storage and OTA software holder for a project myself and Oops from the Arrma-forum are working on.

-Currently the app folder houses the main.py and should eventualy hold all the additional modules that are needed for this project.

-I'll try to keep the current version of Micropython OTA firmware stored in the root directory

-I'm using the thonny 3.31 Text editor / IDE to write the uPy code in, test out stuff in the shell, serial debug, flash teh firmware, and keep track of space used up as the esp32 module I have only has 4MB of memory.

-Right now there is also the pinout image for the module to make it easier for me to decide where to place IO resources and for what I can and cannout incorperate.

Don't pay attention to hte version number listed in the print() on the main.py code, it's just there so I can make sure that when the OTA update says the current pulled software is update I can confirm it.
